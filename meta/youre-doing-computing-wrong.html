    <h1>you're doing computing wrong</h1>
    <p>
      all your life you've been tricked. they told you how to do computing.
      you've been fooled. read this blog post and i show you the way out. i am
      the first person to get it right. nobody before has ever tried this..
    </p>
    <p>
      i'm sorry, this was just an exaggerated version of the typical blog post /
      article / life philosophy / opinion piece. i don't want this blog post to
      be that way.. what i want to write about, is my personal struggle with
      blogging / devlogging, and how i found a solution that seems to work
      better for me, compared to what i've tried before. this post is mostly for
      myself, to put my experience with blogging into words.
    </p>
    <h2>my struggle</h2>
    <p>
      you're reading this text on the 4th version of my blog / devlog / garden
      whatever you want to call it. i've set up my
      <a
        href="https://loophole-letters.vercel.app/"
        target="_blank"
        style="color: yellow"
        >first blog</a
      >
      with a tool called gatsby, which was the hot new thing back a few years
      ago. it had a blog template so i gave it a go. it did its job, but it was
      very annoying to customize.. the details don't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      i then migrated my posts to Next.js because it was the hot new thing a
      while later. it was easier to customize, but annoying to deploy. they had
      some image optimization thing that only worked in server mode, so I went
      to vercel for deployment. i wrote a lot of interactive posts in mdx, with
      react components sprinkled in. it was great, but it became harder and
      harder to write, because i tried to reuse components as much as possible.
      when writing new stuff, i often changed the components, so i would need to
      update the old posts using those components.. i was also using npm
      packages like there was no tomorrow, which meant a lot of maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      after a while, i felt more and more annoyed to write on it, so i thought:
      let's try the hot new thing, which was astro. instead of migrating my
      posts, i started
      <a
        href="https://loophole-letters.netlify.app/"
        target="_blank"
        style="color: yellow"
        >my second blog</a
      >
      from a blank slate, because i was too lazy to do so. my mistake was that i
      only changed the framework, but i didn't change my way of writing. again,
      i've built a complex network of components + used a bunch of npm packages.
    </p>
    <h2>my way out</h2>
    <p>
      again, i felt emotionally blocked to write. this is not how i want my blog
      to be. i want to open my folder, start writing, commit, push and it should
      be live. i want it to be effortless. i want to maximize the chance of me
      writing more. i don't want it to break after a few years. i don't want to
      spend any time with anything else than writing. i don't want to keep
      packages up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      a lot of people in the alternative computing bubble are babbling about
      complexity, and how it all got out of hand in the web dev space. i always
      paid some attention to these opinions, but still i've kept my stack so
      complex. part of the reason was that i am a web dev by trade, and it's
      business as usual to use these complex stacks. i'm used to these tools,
      and to thick node_modules folders. it's how the industry works. i also
      partly questioned the competence of the people with these opinions, i
      thought it's a good way for beginners to do things.. me, a *professional*
      developer wouldn't bother with writing vanilla JS or plain CSS...
    </p>
    <p>
      slowly, i realized that the tools that work for the software industry are
      not necessarily the tools that work for the individual. i've written a lot
      of small live coding tools lately. i've noticed it's much simpler to
      prototype things in a single HTML file, as i don't need a build tool,
      switch files, install packages etc.. a single html file even works without
      a server (most of the time). you can send it around and it *just* works.
      it's also a good thing that you don't have to be a *professional*
      developer to be able to read/understand/change a thing.
    </p>
    <h2>my garden rules</h2>
    <p>
      probably the most influential *idea* that made it click for me was the
      <a href="https://www.tadiweb.com/" target="_blank" style="color: yellow"
        >tadi web</a
      >
      and its *slippy mindset*: "Being slippy means youâ€™re not stuck.". thanks

        >lu wilson</a
      >!<br />ok fuck it, instead of creating one repo per single html file
      prototype, why not create a single repo and dump all html files in there?
    </p>
    <p>
      after 39 posts in this new format, i'm sure it has a positive effect on
      me. over these posts, i've developed a set of not too serious, fluid
      rules, that i've never written down:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>use one file</strong>: each post is one self-contained html
        file, including html, css and js. no external files!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>no build tool</strong>: the html file is written by hand,
        without using a build tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>no dependencies</strong>: no external packages are used. i write
        my own tools. no npm
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>show source</strong>: each file shows its own source at the
        bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>simple > short</strong>: being simple is better than being
        short. i'm not code golfing, i'm code gardening. short is still a nice
        bonus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>keep it wet</strong>: wet = write every time, instead of dry =
        dont repeat yourself. a dry garden can't grow. garden work means
        repetition. be copy paste friendly. i try to organize my code in a way
        that i can quickly reuse code from earlier posts by copy pasting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>no distractions</strong>: a garden is a place to relax. don't
        link bomb people, focus on the thing. still don't forget to give credit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>keep it short</strong>: i used to write very long posts that
        took a long time. it's difficult to stay focused for a long time. rather
        keep it short and increase the chance of getting it out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>keep it broken</strong>: still publish it if it's broken or
        *scrappy*, or not perfect. a broken idea is better than something that
        never gets out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>break your own rules</strong>: be pragmatic. for example i use a
        font file for syntax highlighting, and sometimes i want to use an
        external tool like graphviz, which i then package as a single js file. i
        don't want to invent the universe before i write about something that
        interests me.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>this is not a paradigm</h2>
    <p>
      again, this is only what i've found to be a good habit for me. don't take
      this too seriously. have fun, be kind and don't forget to turn off your
      computer from time to time.
