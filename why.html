sharp package doesn't compile on my system.. why is sharp needed.. try "npm ls sharp" and "npm explain sharp", but both dont work
try switching to node 14, running npm i

that actually worked for the install. but running the dev server fails with a log thats so long i don't want to bother
ok, so trying to revert package-lock
